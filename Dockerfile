ARG COPILOT_CLI_VERSION=1.0.69

# Pin the Postgres major version baked in for project databases (opt-in at runtime).
ARG POSTGRES_VERSION=16

# Pin pnpm. A concrete version (not the `latest` tag) stops corepack from
# re-resolving it against the npm registry on every invocation — that network
# round-trip plus corepack's download prompt is what hangs an offline/non-allowlisted agent.
ARG PNPM_VERSION=11.5.1

# Global ESLint, a FALLBACK on PATH so `pnpm lint` resolves an `eslint` binary
# when a project hasn't installed its own. A project that deps eslint locally
# always wins (pnpm puts node_modules/.bin first); and a project whose config
# pulls eslint-plugin-* still needs `pnpm install` to resolve those — so this is a
# baseline, not a substitute for project install. Major-pinned, overridable.

# --- pnpm via corepack -------------------------------------------------------
# COREPACK_HOME holds the prepared package-manager cache. The default
# (~/.cache/node/corepack) lands in *root's* home at build time, which the
# non-root agent (uid 1000) cannot read — so the agent's first `pnpm` would miss
# the cache and try to re-download, blocking on corepack's interactive prompt.
# Put the cache in a world-readable shared path instead, and disable the prompt
# so a cache miss can never silently hang. Both ENVs persist into the runtime,
# so the agent reads the same prepared cache and needs no network for pnpm.

# --- Proxy config ------------------------------------------------------------

# source of truth, written to /etc/squid/allowlist.txt at startup by the
